# Gweedore Software Tester Course 2019-2020 Samples

This project contains sample code produced during class of the above named course.

Code was produced via live coding in class as demoed by course tutor as well as via collective coding 
with students contributing to code that was written as part of class exercises.

Note: Not all coding best practices are employed as certain concepts were only employed once class had knowledge of 
these (e.g. use of abstract or final where appropriate).  Also, getters and setters were sometimes left out
to keep code simple when demonstrating a different concept.
